This repository demonstrates my learning journey with Structured Query Language (SQL). I first learned about SQL through my Database Administration and Design course while enrolled at the University of South Florida during my undergraduate degree. I loved learning about it so much that I have been inspired to continue my learning, create projects, and hopefully earn professional certifications.
